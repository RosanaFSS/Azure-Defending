<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>

<p>This room introduces you to the analysis of security logs with Microsoft Sentinel KQL. As security engineers, we think of security logs as treasures because they can help us discover the hidden activities within our infrastructure. A quick background intro: Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) product that utilizes ingested logs to provide better visibility into your environment. On the other hand, Kusto Query Language (KQL) is the tool used to proactively reveal the hidden secrets within those logs if you are the curious and hands-on type.<br><br>

Imagine being able to:<br>

- Track down rogue user activities accurately and identify potential breaches before they happen.<br>
- Unravel complex security incidents by correlating events and figuring out every attacker's moves.<br>
- Automating repeated tasks to focus on more serious threats and investigations.</p>

<br>
<p>The focus of this room is Kusto Query Language (KQL), which empowers you, the security analyst/engineer, to become a security sleuth, proactively hunting for threats to ensure your organization's digital infrastructure is safe from attackers. Let's dive into the world of KQL to discover the power of security logs analysis.</p>

<br>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>This room aims to provide you with the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary to use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for security analysis within MS Sentinel Log Analytics workspace. Upon completion, you will be able to:<br>

- Better understand the core concepts and functionalities of Microsoft Sentinel as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.<br>
- Easily understand the benefits of using Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Microsoft Sentinel for day-to-day security operations.<br>
- Understand how KQL interacts with data stored within MS Sentinel Log Analytics workspaces and its uses in querying and analyzing them.</p>

<h2>Task 6 . KQL Use Cases</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You did it. I am confident that you now understand the concept and structure of KQL queries. Let's explore real-world scenarios to see how KQL can support you, the security analyst, in gaining deeper insights into your security logs.</p>

<br>

<h3>Real-Life Example</h3>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Task 7 . Conclusion</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Let's summarise what we have learned so far:<br><br>

We discussed MS Sentinel as a robust SIEM solution that enables organizations to easily identify, investigate, and respond to security threats. KQL, on the other hand, is an effective method of querying and analyzing security logs. When combined, they form a holistic security operations tool for securing modern digital infrastructure.<br><br>

As we continue to explore KQL, you'll discover its extensive capabilities for enhancing your organization's overall security posture.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p>To become a skilled security analyst and threat hunter, here are some pointers to get you going:<br>

- Start simple: Begin with basic queries to identify core security events, and gradually progress to more complex ones as you gain confidence.<br>
- Practice makes perfect: The more you practice writing KQL queries, the more comfortable and proficient you'll become.<br>
- Unlock potential: As your KQL proficiency grows, you can delve into advanced concepts like joins, parse, and user-defined functions. These offer even greater capabilities for complex data analysis and threat-hunting scenarios.</p>
