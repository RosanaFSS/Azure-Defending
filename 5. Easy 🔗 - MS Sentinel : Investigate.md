<h1>MS Sentinel: Investigate</h1>

<h3>This challenge was removed from the TryHackMe platform. I wrote a full walkthrough on Medium, and I was very close to finishing it. However, I couldn't complete it because the Azure lab provided presented errors.</h3>

<h3>Investigate and manage incidents in Microsoft Sentinel. Defending Azure learning path → Microsoft Sentinel → Investigate → 5 of 5.</h3>

<h2>Task 1 . Introduction</h2>
<p>Our Microsoft Sentinel journey continues. Let's take a quick snapshot of where we are in this journey and review the milestones we've passed in the previous rooms:
Onboarding - Microsoft Sentinel concepts, planning and initial deployment<br><br>
  
- Configuration - Installing Content hub solutions<br>
- Configuration - Connecting Data connectors<br>
- Threat detection - Analytics rules enabled</p>


<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>In this room, we will look into incident investigation and management concepts to see how we can easily manage security incidents in Microsoft Sentinel.<br><br>

- Firstly, we'll introduce incident tools and features in Microsoft Sentinel<br>
- Then, investigate sample incidents<br>
- Finally, we'll see how we can manage incidents, hand them over, or escalate them a higher level security team</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>A good understanding of previous Sentinel rooms is recommended to fully leverage the benefits of this room:<br><br>

- MS Sentinel: Introduction<br>
- MS Sentinel: Deploy<br>
- MS Sentinel: Ingest Data<br>
- MS Sentinel: Detect</p>

<h2>Task 2 . Events / Alerts / Incidents</h2>
<p>[ ... ]</p>

<h3>Real-Life Analogy - House Monitoring System</p>
<p>To better understand the similarities and differences between events, alerts, and incidents, let's imagine a typical daily scenario: a House Monitoring System.<br><br>
  
Imagine a 24/7 camera monitoring the entrance of a house. This camera will surely capture many snapshots of activities happening. Let's further assume a family of 3–4 household members living there. Surely, this family will go about their days and will be entering and exiting the house, back and forth, many times during the day.<br><br>

With this background context, consider the following situations in which each moment is captured by the camera. Let's use these moments to explain events, alerts, and incidents.</p>

<h4>Scene 1 : Event</h4>h4>
<p>[ ... ]</p>

<br>

<h4>Scene 2 : Alert</h4>h4>
<p>[ ... ]</p>

<br>

<h4>Scene 3 : Incident</h4>h4>
<p>[ ... ]</p>

<br>


<p>With the above mental picture in mind, let's define events, alerts, and incidents in the context of IT security operations.</p>

<br>

<p>Event data can be vast; in this case, only certain events passing defined thresholds will be categorized as alerts. In the context of Microsoft Sentinel, these rules and thresholds are defined in Analytics rules, as seen in the MS Sentinel: Detect room.<br><br>
Understanding these terms, their differences, and how they relate to any security monitoring application is crucial for investigating and managing incidents.<br><br>
After the real-life analogy above and explanations, I hope all three terms are as clear as mud. Let's move on to see how to perform investigations and manage incidents throughout the rest of this room. Specifically, we will look into how events, alerts, and incidents are represented and managed in different parts and screens of Microsoft Sentinel.<br><br>
Let's move on to incident triage and investigations.</p>

<h2>Task 3 . Incidents Overview</h2>
<p>Now that all the fundamental security concepts - events, alerts, incidents - are covered in detail, let's see how Microsoft Sentinel presents these concepts and what additional information is available for investigation.</p>
