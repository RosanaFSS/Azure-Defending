<h3>Lab Scenario</h3>
<p>In this lab task, as the security admin in charge of Microsoft Defender XDR, you receive an incident alert of a malicious PowerShell script on a user device and must investigate the incident before escalation. </p>

<p>Note: To follow through, you can use the lab credentials and URL below:</p>

Since this is a multi-stage incident, it's expected to see other related incidents. However, we are particular about the suspicious PowerShell script.<br><br>

On the new screen, the following can be seen:<br>

1 . The device involved<br>
2 . The user account involved<br>
3 . The time of each execution or event<br>
4 . The event name. You can click on each event to see the script on the sidebar<br>
5 . The executed script<br>

After investigation, if this alert is considered a malicious event, the following can be done to mitigate the threat and prevent further escalation.<br>

- We can run an antivirus scan.<br>
- Restrict applications from executing on this machine<br>
- Start Microsoft Defender XDR automated investigation<br>
- Isolate the device to prevent lateral movement or the attack from getting access to other devices<br>
