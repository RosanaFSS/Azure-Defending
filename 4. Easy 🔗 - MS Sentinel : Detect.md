Hey there, fellow lifelong learner! I´m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanafssantos/">Rosana</a>, and I’m genuinely excited to join you on this adventure.<br>
It´s part of my $$\textcolor{#FF69B4}{\textbf{349}}$$-day-streak in  <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a>.<br><br>
<h1 align="center"> $$\textcolor{#3bd62d}{\textnormal{MS Sentinel: Detect}}$$</h1>
<p align="center">It is classified as as easy-level walkthrough.</p>

<br>

<h3><code><em>This challenge was removed from the TryHackMe platform. I wrote a full walkthrough on Medium, and I was very close to finishing it. However, I couldn't complete it because the Azure lab provided presented errors.</em></code></h3>
